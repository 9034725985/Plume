# Plume [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Plume-org/Plume.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Plume-org/Plume)

Federated blogging engine, based on ActivityPub. It uses the Rocket framework, and Diesel to interact with the database.

It is not yet ready for production use, but we have all the basic features (account management, blogs, articles, comments, etc) and a basic federation.
